# PvPCasino

## A Fair, Player-vs-Player Casino Platform

### Core Concept

PvPCasino reimagines online gambling by eliminating the house edge and focusing on player-vs-player competition. Instead of betting against a casino with built-in mathematical advantages, players compete directly against each other, with the platform taking only a small 5% commission on each pot.

### Why PvPCasino?

Traditional online casinos operate on a fundamental principle: the house always wins in the long run. Every game has a mathematical edge favoring the casino, ensuring their profit regardless of individual player outcomes.

PvPCasino takes a different approach:

- **No House Edge**: Games have no built-in mathematical advantage against players
- **Player vs Player**: All bets are placed against other players, not the house
- **Transparent Commission**: We take only a small, clearly disclosed 5% commission
- **Social Gambling**: Compete directly with friends and other players
- **Skill & Strategy**: Greater emphasis on skill, strategy, and social dynamics

### Wheel

Wheel is our first and flagship game, featuring:

- A dynamic wheel where players buy sections proportional to their bets
- Visual representation of odds through the size of each player's section
- Multi-round gameplay with persistent table balances
- Real-time updates as players place bets
- Social interaction through lobby chat

### How It Works

1. **Join a Lobby**: Select a stake level appropriate to your bankroll
2. **Buy In**: Exchange your balance for a stack of chips at the table
3. **Place Bets**: Contribute to the pot to secure your section of the wheel
4. **Watch the Spin**: See the wheel spin and land on the winning section
5. **Play Multiple Rounds**: Keep your stack and continue playing as long as you want
6. **Cash Out**: Leave the table anytime and convert your remaining stack to your account balance

### Coming Soon

- **Texas Hold'em Poker**: Classic poker with our player-vs-player, commission-only model
- **Horse Racing**: Back different horses in pari-mutuel style betting pools
- **Tournaments**: Scheduled competitions with prize pools and elimination rounds
- **Friend System**: Connect with other players and track their activity

### Join the Revolution

PvPCasino represents a fundamental shift in how online gambling works. By focusing on player-vs-player competition and transparent commission structures, we're creating a fairer, more engaging gambling environment where skill and strategy matter more than luck.

Whether you're a casual player looking for a more social experience or a serious gambler tired of fighting against the house edge, PvPCasino offers a refreshing alternative to traditional online casinos.
